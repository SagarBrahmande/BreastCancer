**ClumpThickness**: Refers to the thickness of cell clusters present in the breast tissue. In medical terms, it signifies how much the cells are sticking together in a cluster.

**UniformityCellSize**: Indicates how uniform the size of cells is within a sample. An increased level of uniformity can sometimes indicate healthier tissue.

**UniformityCellShape**: Similar to cell size, this feature indicates the uniformity of the cell shapes within a sample. Deviations in cell shape can be indicative of abnormalities.

**MarginalAdhesion**: Represents the degree of adhesion or sticking together of cells at the margins or edges of the tissue sample. Increased adhesion might imply higher chances of malignancy.

**SingleEpithelialCellSize**: Refers to the size of a single layer of epithelial cells. Deviations from the normal size could indicate abnormalities.

**BareNuclei**: Indicates the presence of cell nuclei without the surrounding cytoplasm in a tissue sample. Abnormalities in bare nuclei can signify malignancy.

**BlandChromatin**: Chromatin refers to the material in the cell nucleus that condenses to form chromosomes during cell division. The term "bland" might indicate the uniformity or regularity of chromatin appearance.

**NormalNucleoli**: Nucleoli are small structures within a cell nucleus involved in the production of ribosomes. "Normal" here likely signifies the regularity or presence of these structures.

**Mitoses**: Refers to the number of cell divisions observed in a tissue sample. Elevated mitotic activity can suggest faster cell proliferation, which is often seen in cancerous tissues.

**CancerType**: This column likely holds the classification or label indicating the type or presence of cancer in the sample (e.g., malignant or benign).
